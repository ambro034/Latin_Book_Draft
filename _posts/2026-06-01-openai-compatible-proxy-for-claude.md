I built a small service called **`llm-batcher`**: a FastAPI proxy that speaks the
**OpenAI Chat Completions API** on the front and the **Anthropic Messages API** on
the back. Any tool that already emits OpenAI-shaped requests (an SDK, `curl`,
LangChain) can point at it and get **Claude** instead, with zero client changes.

- **Repo:** [github.com/NeverTheSame/llm-batcher](https://github.com/NeverTheSame/llm-batcher)
- **Stack:** Python 3.12, FastAPI, httpx (async), Pydantic v2, Docker
- **Tests:** 5 unit tests, mocked upstream, no API key required, all green

It's deliberately small: a clean pass-through with request/response translation and
a real test suite. But it's the seed of the thing an inference-serving team actually
runs in production: adaptive batching, routing, backpressure, and a cost/latency
observatory.

## Why a proxy at all

I've spent years as an SRE keeping distributed systems alive: Kubernetes, Terraform,
observability, the on-call pager. I'm deliberately pointing those skills at **AI
inference**, the part of the ML stack that's *least* about training and *most* about
the thing I already do: serving traffic reliably, cheaply, and fast at scale. (I
[said roughly this in a Staff AI Engineer interview]({{ '/job-interviews/2026-05-25-staff-ai-engineer-interview.html' | relative_url }}),
less model magic and more boring engineering.)

The insight that unlocked the project: **an LLM inference proxy is just a reverse
proxy with interesting backpressure.** Connection pooling, request batching, queueing
under load, latency budgets, cost telemetry. Those are exactly the problems I've
solved for databases and microservices. I don't need to learn ML from scratch; I need
to point existing skills at a new kind of upstream. It's the same "treat generative AI
like any other production workload" stance I took on
[Composer LLM]({{ '/ai/2025-11-20-composer-llm-model.html' | relative_url }}) and the
[Hugging Face model radar]({{ '/ai/2025-11-20-huggingface-model-radar.html' | relative_url }}),
just from the serving side instead of the model-selection side.

## What it does

```
┌────────────────┐   OpenAI-shaped    ┌───────────────┐   Anthropic-shaped   ┌──────────────────┐
│ OpenAI client  │ ─ POST /v1/chat/ ─▶│  llm-batcher  │ ─ POST /v1/messages ▶│  Anthropic API   │
│ (SDK, curl,    │   completions      │  (translates  │                      │  (Claude models) │
│  LangChain…)   │◀─ chat.completion ─│   both ways)  │◀─ messages response ─│                  │
└────────────────┘                    └───────────────┘                      └──────────────────┘
```

Concretely, the proxy:

1. **Accepts an OpenAI `POST /v1/chat/completions` request**, the de-facto shape
   nearly every LLM tool already emits.
2. **Translates it to Anthropic's Messages format** (the two contracts differ in
   subtle, important ways; more below).
3. **Forwards it** to `https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages` over async httpx, with a
   timeout and proper error propagation.
4. **Translates Claude's response back** into the OpenAI `chat.completion` shape,
   including `usage` token counts and a mapped `finish_reason`, so the caller never
   knows it wasn't talking to OpenAI.
5. Exposes **`GET /health`** for liveness checks (the SRE in me refuses to ship a
   service without one).

## The interesting part: the two APIs are *almost* the same

This is the kind of detail that looks trivial until you wire it up. OpenAI and
Anthropic both do "chat," but the contracts diverge in ways that *will* bite you.

### 1. The system prompt lives in a different place

OpenAI carries the system prompt as a *message* with `role: "system"` inside the
`messages` array. Anthropic does **not** allow a `system` role inside `messages`. The
system prompt is a **top-level field**. So the translator has to lift every `system`
message out of the array and join them into the top-level `system` field:

```python
def _to_anthropic_payload(req: ChatCompletionRequest) -> dict[str, Any]:
    system_parts: list[str] = []
    messages: list[dict[str, str]] = []
    for m in req.messages:
        if m.role == "system":
            system_parts.append(m.content)
        else:
            role = "assistant" if m.role == "assistant" else "user"
            messages.append({"role": role, "content": m.content})

    if not messages:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400,
                            detail="At least one non-system message is required.")

    payload = {
        "model": req.model or DEFAULT_MODEL,
        "max_tokens": req.max_tokens or DEFAULT_MAX_TOKENS,
        "messages": messages,
    }
    if system_parts:
        payload["system"] = "\n\n".join(system_parts)
    return payload
```

### 2. `max_tokens` is optional in OpenAI but **required** in Anthropic

Forward an OpenAI request that omits `max_tokens` and Anthropic rejects it. The proxy
defaults it (`DEFAULT_MAX_TOKENS`, env-configurable) so callers don't have to care.

### 3. The response envelope is shaped differently

Anthropic returns content as a list of typed blocks with its own stop-reason and
usage names. OpenAI clients expect `choices[].message.content`, a `finish_reason`, and
`usage` keyed as `prompt_tokens` / `completion_tokens` / `total_tokens`. The translator
flattens the blocks, maps the stop reason, and renames the usage fields:

```python
def _to_openai_response(anthropic_json, model):
    text = "".join(b.get("text", "")
                   for b in anthropic_json.get("content", [])
                   if b.get("type") == "text")
    stop = anthropic_json.get("stop_reason")
    finish_reason = "stop" if stop in ("end_turn", "stop_sequence") else "length"
    usage = anthropic_json.get("usage", {})
    pt, ct = usage.get("input_tokens", 0), usage.get("output_tokens", 0)
    return {
        "id": "chatcmpl-" + uuid.uuid4().hex,
        "object": "chat.completion",
        "created": int(time.time()),
        "model": model,
        "choices": [{"index": 0,
                     "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": text},
                     "finish_reason": finish_reason}],
        "usage": {"prompt_tokens": pt, "completion_tokens": ct,
                  "total_tokens": pt + ct},
    }
```

### 4. Auth and versioning headers differ

OpenAI uses `Authorization: Bearer <key>`. Anthropic uses a custom header pair, and
forgetting `anthropic-version` is a classic first-time 400:

```python
headers = {
    "x-api-key": api_key,
    "anthropic-version": "2023-06-01",
    "content-type": "application/json",
}
```

Pinning the version in one place means I never chase that bug across call sites.

## Engineering choices (and the SRE reasoning behind them)

**Async all the way down (`httpx.AsyncClient`).** A proxy's whole job is to wait on an
upstream. Blocking I/O would cap concurrency at the worker count; async lets one
process hold thousands of in-flight requests cheaply, which matters enormously once
batching enters the picture, because batching is *literally* "hold requests and wait."

**Timeouts and explicit error mapping.** Every upstream call has a timeout. Network
failures become `502 Bad Gateway`; a missing key becomes a clear `500` with a human
message; Anthropic's own errors are propagated with their status code. No silent hangs,
no leaked stack traces. That's the difference between "works on my laptop" and "survives a
bad afternoon in prod."

**Config via environment, secrets via `.env` (git-ignored).** `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`,
`DEFAULT_MODEL`, `DEFAULT_MAX_TOKENS`, and `REQUEST_TIMEOUT_S` are all env-driven. The
repo ships a `.env.example` and a `.gitignore` that keeps real keys out of version
control, verified before I made the repo public.

**Pydantic v2 request models.** Incoming requests validate against a typed schema, so
malformed input fails fast with a 422 instead of exploding three layers deep.

## Testing without spending a cent (or leaking a key)

I wanted a suite that runs in CI with **no API key and no network**, because tests
that hit the real API are slow, flaky, and cost money, and a key in CI is a key that
can leak. So the upstream Anthropic call is **mocked** and the deterministic
translation logic is tested directly. Five tests cover:

1. System-message lifting into the top-level `system` field
2. Rejecting a request with no non-system message
3. Response-shape translation (content flattening, `finish_reason`, token math)
4. A full **mocked round-trip** through the FastAPI endpoint
5. The `/health` endpoint

```
$ pytest -q
.....                                                    [100%]
5 passed in 1.53s
```

There's also a `tests/smoke.sh` for a live round-trip once you drop in a real key, but
it's never required for the suite to pass.

## Try it yourself

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NeverTheSame/llm-batcher
cd llm-batcher

python3 -m venv venv
./venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt

cp .env.example .env          # then paste your ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
./venv/bin/uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

Now talk to Claude using an **OpenAI-shaped** request:

```bash
curl -sS -X POST http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "claude-3-5-haiku-latest",
    "messages": [
      {"role": "system", "content": "You are terse."},
      {"role": "user", "content": "Reply with exactly: pong"}
    ],
    "max_tokens": 16
  }'
```

Or run it in a container:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

## Where it's going

Today it's a pass-through. The name, `llm-batcher`, is a promise about the next
bricks: **request batching** (accumulate concurrent requests into one upstream window),
a **cost & latency observatory** (per-request p50/p95/p99 and a dollar estimate),
**backpressure and concurrency caps** (graceful degradation under load), and a
**benchmark harness** to put throughput-vs-latency-vs-cost numbers on the table.

The point isn't to build a production gateway; those exist. The point is to
demonstrate, in public, that I think about LLM serving the way an inference engineer
does: in terms of tail latency, fleet efficiency, and dollars per million tokens, not
model accuracy.
